# Configure stream views
Stream views provide flexibility in the use of types and allow you to expose data as a different type. 
While you cannot actually change the properties of types themselves, the stream views feature enables you to create a view of a selected stream that appears as if you had changed the type on which it is based. You create a stream view by choosing a source and target type then a set of mappings between properties of those two types.
For more information, see stream views(xref:whatOCSdoes#stream-views). To configure stream views, follow this procedure:

1. Create types. 
- Create the source type.
- Create the target type. 
2. Create the target type. 
3. Create the source stream
