# Delete a community

From the `Community Details` page, you can delete a community. The ability to delete a community lets you limit access to a community to only users who need it and only when they need it. After you delete a community, no users can access it again.

**Note:** Only a Community Administrator or a Tenant Administrator can perform this procedure.

1. On the navigation bar, click **Communities**.
2. On the `Communities` page, find the community you want to delete and click **Details**.
3. On the `Community Details` page, click **More Options** ![More Options](..\images\MoreOptions.png "More Options") at the top-right and select **Delete Community** from the pop-up menu.
4. Confirm the deletion by entering the name of the community to delete and click **Delete**.
