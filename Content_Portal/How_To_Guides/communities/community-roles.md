# Community roles

When using Communities, you must [assign users to roles](xref:managecommunityusers#assign-user-roles) that grant permissions for certain types of actions.

In Communities, the following roles are available, ordered from least privileged to most privileged:

### Community Member

A role authorized to read any data shared in the community.

### Data Steward

A role that can share a tenantâ€™s data with any community to which the data steward belongs. A Data Steward can grant this privilege (that is, the Data Steward role) to other users in their own tenant.

### Community Moderator

A role that manages the community for a tenant. Usually, a Community Moderator who accepts the invitation to join a community on behalf of a tenant. This user must also be a Tenant Administrator for the same tenant.

A Community Moderator's primary purpose is to specify which tenant's users have access to a community. Community Moderators have all privileges of a Community Member, with the ability to:  

- Pause access to shared data from their tenant
- Add users from their tenant to the community
- Remove their tenant's users from the community
- Remove their tenant from the community

Community Moderators can assign the following roles to users in their own tenant:

- Community Member
- Community Moderator

### Community Administrator

A role that grants full administrative rights. These rights include all the privileges of a Community Moderator plus the ability to:

- Delete the community
- Invite tenants to the community
- Remove tenants from the community

Community Administrators in the [Community Owner's](#community-owner) tenant can assign any role to any user in any tenant that belongs to the community. Community Administrators in tenants other than the Community Owner's tenant can assign any role to users in their own tenant.

## Related roles and identities

In addition to the roles you can assign in Communities, be aware of the following related roles and identities:

### Tenant Administrator

A tenant-level role that allows users to administer their own tenant. The Tenant Administrator role applies to all of OCS rather than just to Communities. In OCS, user roles are managed as part of the Security component.

### Community Owner

A tenant who created a community. A Community Owner is not a role and is not granted any privileges. By default, Tenant Administrators are granted the privilege to create communities.
